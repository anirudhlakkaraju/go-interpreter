# Writing an Interpreter in Go

Welcome to my implementation of *Writing an Interpreter in Go* by Thorsten Ball. This project focuses on building a simple interpreter for the Monkey Programming language using Go.

Go read the [book](https://interpreterbook.com/). It's incredible!

## Overview

This repository contains my code and notes as I work through the book. Iâ€™m covering key concepts like:

- **Parsing**: Converting source code into a format that can be processed.
- **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)**: Structuring the code in a tree format.
- **Evaluation**: Running the code represented by the AST.

I'm implementing everything as I read.

## Installation

Coming Soon! As soon as I'm done building the interpreter.

Feel free to check out the code as I develop this interpreter. Contriutions are welcome!
